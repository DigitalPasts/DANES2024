title: Digital Ancient Near Eastern Studies Conference
---

We are excited to announce that the [second Digital Ancient Near Eastern Studies conference (#DANES24)](https://digitalpasts.github.io/DANES2024/){:target="_blank"} will take place as a **virtual event on 5-6 December** 2024 during the afternoon hours CET.

This year’s theme is "**Digital Resources of the Ancient Near East: Creation, Application Studies, and Maintenance**". We particularly invite talks about using and expanding digital datasets and databases related to the ancient Near East, as well as talks on the creation, maintenance, and development of such resources.

The DANES conferences series is one of [several activities of the DANES network](https://opendanes.org/pages/Digital%20Ancient%20Near%20Eastern%20Studies%20-%20A%20Transition%20to%20Arts%20and%20Crafts.html){:target="_blank"}, whose purpose is to establish and maintain a community of practitioners of digital and computational methods for the study of the ancient world.

The exploration of texts and artifacts as data using the plethora of computational tools and techniques available today requires additional training outside one’s area of expertise. This interdisciplinary approach has been growing rapidly in recent years and developing its own best practice standards and conventions that require familiarization with several fields of study.

The purpose of the DANES conferences is to highlight recent work that bridges these diverse fields, showcasing current best practice, informing the community about ongoing research among its members, and introducing more students and scholars of the ancient world to innovative approaches made possible with current technological developments.

In particular, this year's theme is intended to showcase the research that is only possible when sources are made available digitally and as openly as possible. It also aims to highlight the increasing amount of work our community does in creating and maintaining resources and tools.

### Wednesday, December 4: Pre-Conference Workshops

Workshops are 90-minute sessions that provide active tutorials or in depth discussions with participants about emerging technologies and their applications for ancient Near Eastern studies.

   <td><b>Fine-Tuning LLMs for Ancient Language Processing</b>

    <br>Shai Gordin and Emma Yavaşan (Digital Pasts Lab, Ariel University)

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

This hands-on workshop explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to analyze ancient languages with limited available data, using Hittite as the primary case study. Participants will learn the practical aspects of fine-tuning LLMs for tasks like glossing (linguistic analysis) of Hittite texts, including how to prepare datasets and evaluate model performance when working with complex ancient languages. The workshop balances theoretical understanding with practical application, teaching attendees how to adapt these modern AI tools for analyzing ancient languages while addressing the unique challenges of working with limited historical data and complex grammatical structures. The knowledge gained will be applicable not only to Hittite but also to other ancient languages, making this workshop valuable for scholars working across different historical linguistic traditions.

   <td><b>Towards (Semi-)automatic Annotation of Cuneiform Signs</b>

    <br>Jan Philipp Bullenkamp (Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg) and Timo Homburg (Mainz University)

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

We will start with a talk on advances in the assisted annotation of media, e.g. renderings and 3D models containing cuneiform signs. At first we present an extension of the [Gigamesh Software](https://gigamesh.eu/?page=home) Framework which is able to load 2D-created annotations of rendering images and to export them as 3D annotations as well as create 3D annotations directly on the mesh. Further we discuss how 3D annotations might be stored in an interoperable exchange format and highlight ongoing discussions of the NFDI4Objects standardization group for 3D annotations. This will help the audience to gain an insight on future interoperability of annotation formats in different 3D processing software.

The second part of our talk will feature a watershed-based approach for cuneiform wedge detection and classification according to the wedge types in [PaleoCodage](https://situx.github.io/PaleoCodage/). We evaluate its success rate, its compatibility with and applicability in the workflow of a computer scientist and its benefits to Near Eastern studies. Afterwards we will demonstrate use cases for both aforementioned technologies. We then want to discuss the applicability and feasibility in an annotation workflow for Near Eastern scholars together with the participants.

   <td><b>Building The FactGrid Cuneiform Project: How to Make a Knowledge Graph for Cuneiform Studies</b>

    <br>Adam Anderson (UC Berkeley)

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

FactGrid is a free, open-source Knowledge Graph database built on Wikibase technology that allows historians worldwide to collaboratively build and edit customizable databases. While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have a learning curve, they offer deep, domain-specific data curated by specialists, making them valuable complements to Large Language Models (LLMs), which often suffer from hallucinations due to their reliance on broad, unreliable online data.

This workshop aims to teach participants how to build a Knowledge Graph database for cuneiform texts, covering everything from Wikibase setup to integrating various online databases and implementing linguistic annotations. The ultimate goal is to develop a comprehensive model that can query these knowledge bases using natural language, incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for SPARQL queries and deep learning models for multilingual word sense disambiguation for ancient languages written in the cuneiform script.
