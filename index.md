title: Digital Ancient Near Eastern Studies Conference
---

In recent decades, the rich cultural heritage of the Near East is undergoing a digital revolution. Comprehensive online repositories have made the digital publishing of artefacts in 2D images, interactive 3D models, as well as text editions, a more sustainable common practice. Furthermore, computational analyses of ancient Near Eastern artefacts, texts and art, are starting to become more prevalent, applying quantitative analyses, natural language processing (NLP) or machine learning (ML), to answer questions about these complex ancient civilizations.

The conference, Computational Perspectives on Ancient Near Eastern Literature, Art and Material Culture, aims to establish a professional network for Digital Ancient Near Eastern Studies (DANES). This will consolidate the successes of recent initiatives led by different research centers, and discuss how best to integrate computational approaches and digital humanities research for ancient Near Eastern texts, art and artefacts. Lastly, we will Incorporate into these discussions a critical perspective on the use of computational methods for text analysis, as well the visual analysis of ancient Near Eastern objects. This conference will include invited long and short talks, an in retrospect section, and poster presentations.

We invite students and scholars to present their original papers in the conference, either remotely or in person, on the application of one or more of the following methodologies and issues:

- Applying linked open data (LOD) conventions
- 2D and 3D imaging
- Machine learning for low resource datasets
- Computational text analysis and natural language processing (NLP)
- Computer vision and optical character recognition (OCR)
- Critical debates on the use of computational methods for ancient sources
